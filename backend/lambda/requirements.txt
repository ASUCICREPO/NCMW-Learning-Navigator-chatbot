# Lambda Function Dependencies
# These will be packaged with Lambda or in Lambda Layer

# =====================================================================
# STEP 8: RAG WITH OPENSEARCH (CURRENT)
# =====================================================================

# AWS SDK - boto3 and botocore are INCLUDED in Lambda runtime by default
# No need to package them - they're always available in Lambda environment
# boto3==1.34.0  # Not needed - built-in
# botocore==1.34.0  # Not needed - built-in

# RAG Dependencies (will be packaged in Lambda Layer)
opensearch-py==2.4.2            # OpenSearch client
requests-aws4auth==1.2.3        # IAM authentication for OpenSearch
PyPDF2==3.0.1                   # PDF text extraction
langchain==0.1.10               # LangChain for RAG orchestration
langchain-aws==0.1.0            # AWS integrations for LangChain
langchain-community==0.0.24     # Community integrations

# Note: These dependencies will be packaged in a Lambda Layer
# because they exceed the 50MB direct upload limit.
# Total size with dependencies: ~150MB

# =====================================================================
# WHY LAMBDA LAYER?
# =====================================================================
# Lambda has two deployment options:
# 1. Direct upload: Max 50MB zipped (simple, but limited)
# 2. Lambda Layer: Max 250MB unzipped (complex, but flexible)
#
# Our RAG dependencies (opensearch-py + langchain + PyPDF2) are ~150MB
# So we MUST use a Lambda Layer
#
# Alternative: Use Docker container image (10GB limit, slower cold starts)
